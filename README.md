**Recently I have been working on finetuning text-to-image and built a few QLoRAs. Apologies ☠️ as I am spending less time working on GitHub. Feel free to check out some of the works I have done 🔥 and do not hesitate to follow me on <a href=https://huggingface.co/je-suis-tm>HuggingFace</a> 🤗**

**Thank you for visiting :innocent: I am not sure how many people actually have the patience to reach here. If that's you, 🎩 off. I really appreciate how many :star: you guys have given to <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading>Quant Trading</a>. As you can see, I have devoted more and more energy towards other respositories such as <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/graph-theory>Graph Theory</a> and <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/machine-learning>Machine Learning</a>. Take a tour and you won't be disappointed :smirk: Meanwhile, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to raise issues in the repository so we can start :speech_balloon: I genuinely enjoy conversations with people from diverse background and they never stop to inspire me to develop new perspectives to tackle challenges in life :muscle:**

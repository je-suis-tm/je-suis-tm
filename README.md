### 👋 there

**I am currently looking for PhD positions with funding in applied/computational mathematics and statistics. My preferable location would be north/west Europe as I would love to stay close to my family. My domains of interest would be**

* Bayesian Statistics: Latent Variables, Statistical Modeling, Statistical Inference;
* Graph Theory: Complex System, Agent-based Modelling, Application in Ecology and Epidemiology;
* Machine Learning: Matrix Completion, Recommender System, Feature Selection, Causality Detection;
* Operations Research: Convex Optimization, Network Analysis, Game Theory;
 
**If you happen to know any vacancy or anyone who shares the same enthusiasm, please kindly refer to me, thank you!**

**I truly believe in Bitcoin and decentralization despite the carbon footprint (still smaller than 🏦). Central banks are crooked and they only serve the rich :thumbsdown: Hence, HODL 💎 🙌 💎 FYI, do you know bitcoin has higher Sharpe ratio than S&P 500 from this <a href=https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-risk-adjusted-return>chart</a>? I was skeptical at first until I ran my own test on the <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/blob/master/data/bitcoin.csv>dataset</a> from Bloomberg terminal. Well, bitcoin beats conventional assets in their own game so they say <a href=https://www.quora.com/Does-the-Sharpe-ratio-work-with-Bitcoin>the benchmark should not apply to bitcoin</a> :satisfied: Obviously those who loathe bitcoin are the same group of people who rig the game and expect you to pay 20/2 for their actively managed funds. Thanks but no thanks :triumph:**

**Thank you for visiting :innocent: I really appreciate how many :star: you guys have given to <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading>Quant Trading</a>. For those of you who crave for more intellectual challenges, check out some other respositories such as <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/graph-theory>Graph Theory</a> and <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/machine-learning>Machine Learning</a>, you won't be disappointed :smirk: If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to raise issues in the repository so we can start :speech_balloon: I genuinely enjoy conversations with people from diverse background and they never stop to inspire me to develop new perspectives to tackle challenges in life :muscle:**

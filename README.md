### 👋 there

**I truly believe in Bitcoin and decentralization despite the carbon footprint (still smaller than 🏦). Central banks are crooked and they only serve the rich :thumbsdown: So  hodl 💎 🙌 💎 FYI, do you believe bitcoin has higher Sharpe ratio than S&P 500 from this <a href=https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-risk-adjusted-return>chart</a>? I was skeptical until I ran my own test on the <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/blob/master/data/bitcoin.csv>dataset</a> from Bloomberg terminal. Obviously those who loathe bitcoin are the same group of people who expect you to pay 20/2 for their actively managed funds. Thanks but no thanks :triumph:**

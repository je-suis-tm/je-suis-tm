### Merry :santa: and Happy :two: :zero: :two: :two: to everyone across the globe! Hope you stay safe and healthy and maybe off to :moon: 

**It has been two years of endless COVID variants. I haven't seen many of my friends and families overseas for two fucking years and I am sure many of you share the same situation. Will COVID end at Î© variant or we run out of Greek letters? The world cannot be in lockdown twice a year. We must move on. We joked about herd immunity at the beginning and now our wishes come true. Unfortunately, herd immunity is the only way forward with or without vaccines. We should not be frightened by the daily numbers any more because many including my colleagues are asymptotic or merely facing a "common cold". Optimistically, I am seeing the light at the end of tunnel, which is next year. We all hope it is the case, don't we all?**

### What have I been up to lately?

**I know many of you are big fans of my repositories. A lot of you are demanding more options trading strategy in quant trading. Some of you are waiting for the next big project in graph theory. Some of you are asking if I will implement more avant-garde techniques in machine learning. Apologies for the late replies and late deliveries :disappointed: Recently I have been caught up with a lot of office politics and trying to cope with the great resignation (the middle management should seriously look into the mirror and reflect why). Well, now I am working on a new repository, <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding>game modding</a>! If you are a die-hard fan of Sid Meierâ€™s Civilization VI: New Frontier Pass, make sure you check out my new repository! I am totally obsessed with automating the modding process via Python. I used to create mods for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in my youth. That was my entrepÃ´t of programming â€“ hacking into the game engine to create a super cheater! Now I am back where I started. Excited to share this with everyone who will spend Christmas and New Year playing ONE MORE TURN :skull:**

I really appreciate how many :star: you guys have given to <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading>Quant Trading</a>. As you can see, I have devoted more and more energy towards other respositories such as <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/graph-theory>Graph Theory</a> and <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/machine-learning>Machine Learning</a>. Take a tour and you won't be disappointed :smirk: Meanwhile, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to raise issues in the repository so we can start :speech_balloon: I genuinely enjoy conversations with people from diverse background and they never stop to inspire me to develop new perspectives to tackle challenges in life :muscle:**
